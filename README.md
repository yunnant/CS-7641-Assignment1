# CS-7641-Assignment1
This project aims to understand how five classification algorithms (Neural Networks, SVMs, kNNs, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting)behaves under a variety of circumstances. Each algorithm will be run against two binary separate classification datasets for a classification problem that I can compare and contrast them for two different datasets, so that I can learn the behaviors under a similar problem but two totally different datasets.

The problem seeks to build a model to predict whether an individual has or will have diabetes or not, for this study I used health data such as medical data and lifestyle data to determine the like hood.

Data source: You can also download the data from Github
NHANES:

You need to load needed XPT dataset from NHANES database and convert to CSV. I also uplad to data to the Github

PIMA:PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset

I also upload the data to the Github
