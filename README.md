# CS-7641-Assignment1
This project aims to understand how five classification algorithms (Neural Networks, SVMs, kNNs, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting)behaves under a variety of circumstances. Each algorithm will be run against two binary separate classification datasets for a classification problem that I can compare and contrast them for two different datasets, so that I can learn the behaviors under a similar problem but two totally different datasets.

The problem seeks to build a model to predict whether an individual has or will have diabetes or not, for this study I used health data such as medical data and lifestyle data to determine the like hood.
